Middle of the night,
and I'm running back what
you said
You're not even here,
but you still won't let me rest
I'm just so tired,
all these years lost in love
Lost in love
And I'm hanging onto every
word when you're gone
Follow where you lead me,
but you just lead me on
Say that you want me,
I know you don't
No, you don't,
'cause you don't know
What I've been through
Led me to you
You found me, I was broken
You let a little bit of hope in
But you, you broke me too
This is all my own fault,
let you get in my head
Get the best of my heart,
then you leave me for dead
Tell me you love me,
I know you won't
No, you won't,
'cause you don't know
What I've been through
Led me to you
You found me, I was broken
You let a little bit of hope in
But you, you broke me too
What I've been through
Led me to you
You found me, I was broken
You let a little bit of hope in
But you, you broke me too
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh,
you broke me too
Oh, oh, oh,
you broke me too
Oh, oh, oh,
you broke me too
